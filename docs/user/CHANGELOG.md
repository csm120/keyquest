# KeyQuest - Changelog

Canonical handoff / current context: `docs/dev/HANDOFF.md`

Note: Older entries may reference historical file layouts (e.g., `keyquest.pyw:<line>`) from before the modularization work.

## 2026-02-25 - Accessibility Enhancements

### User Guide Updated (README.html)
- Options section now lists all 8 settings individually, including the new Font Size option.
- Quick Start updated to note that the remaining Escape press count is shown on screen.
- Accessibility section expanded with details on HC auto-detection, font scaling, visual keystroke flash, and the escape counter.

### Font Size / DPI Scaling (Options Menu)
- A new **Font Size** option in the Options menu lets you choose between `auto`, `100%`, `125%`, and `150%`.
- `auto` (default) reads your Windows display scale setting and applies it automatically — so users running 125% or 150% DPI get proportionally larger text without any manual configuration.
- Explicit choices override DPI detection for users who prefer a fixed size regardless of system settings.
- Font size is saved with your other settings and applied every time the app starts.

### Escape Press Visual Counter
- When exiting an active mode requires three Escape presses, the remaining press count is now shown visually at the top of the screen (e.g., "Escape: 2 more presses to exit").
- This is a visual complement to the existing speech announcement — both update together.
- The counter disappears automatically once exit completes or any other key is pressed.

### Visual Keystroke Feedback (Deaf / Hard-of-Hearing)
- Correct keystrokes now produce a brief green screen flash in addition to the audio beep.
- Incorrect keystrokes produce a brief red screen flash in addition to the error beep.
- Flash is ~120 ms at low opacity — visible but unobtrusive, and well under the WCAG 2.3.1 photosensitivity threshold.
- Affects: tutorial, lessons, speed test, and sentence practice.

### Windows High Contrast Mode Auto-Detection
- `Auto` theme setting now detects Windows High Contrast mode at the OS level.
- Users who enable High Contrast in Windows Settings → Ease of Access no longer need to manually select it in the Options menu — it activates automatically.

### Lesson Menu Overflow Indicator
- When more lessons are available than fit on screen, a "v  more below  v" indicator is now shown, so users know to keep navigating down.

### Results Screen Controls Hint
- The results screen now shows the standard controls hint at the bottom ("Space/Enter continue; Esc menu"), consistent with all other screens.

### Dark Theme Contrast Improvement
- Dark theme highlight color contrast improved from 4.69:1 to 5.77:1 (WCAG AA minimum is 4.5:1), providing a more comfortable margin for low-vision users.

### Cleaner Screen Reader Dialog Text
- Badge unlock and level-up dialogs no longer include emoji characters in their text content.
- Screen readers that read dialog text directly no longer expand emoji verbosely (e.g., "trophy emoji Badge Unlocked").
- Speech announcements, which already used clean text, are unchanged.

  - Current position is visually highlighted and announced with token + position.
- Improved Hangman sentence-practice `Ctrl+Space` behavior:
  - Remaining text now reads from current typed position instead of falling back to the full sentence.
- Updated Hangman sentence-practice generation quality:
  - Replaced plain repetitive templates with randomized style-based prompts (story, mystery, science, adventure, school, definition, reflective).
  - Each 5-sentence set now favors style variety.
- Tuned Hangman word selection fairness and variety:
  - Removed fixed max-length cap.
  - Max length is now data-driven from available dictionary entries.
  - Selection now weights toward common-length words while still occasionally serving short words and rare very long words (28+ when available).
- Updated user guide (`README.html`) Hangman section to reflect current controls and behavior.

## 2026-02-18 - User Guide Rework + Build Packaging Update

- Replaced the user-facing readme with a non-technical HTML guide:
  - New file: `README.html`
  - Reorganized by Main Menu sections with detailed behavior coverage

    - `README.html` to `dist/KeyQuest/docs/README.html`
  - Existing `README.md` and `docs/user/CHANGELOG.md` distribution copies remain.
- Updated in-app game docs text to match current `Escape x3` return behavior:
  - `games/letter_fall.py`
  - `games/word_typing.py`
  - `games/hangman.py`
  - Active gameplay modes now document `Escape x3` return to main menu.

## 2025-11-14 - Retro Pet Sounds Implementation

### 🔊 Chiptune-Style Pet Sounds Complete

**Redesigned all 7 pet sounds using authentic retro game/chiptune synthesis techniques instead of realistic animal recordings**

#### What Changed

**Menu Update**:
- **"Pet Menu"** renamed to **"Pets: P"** in main menu (`state_manager.py` line 272)
- Added **Dog** as 7th pet type between Cat and Phoenix

**Sound Synthesis Philosophy Shift**:
- **Previous approach**: Realistic animal sounds analyzed from professional sound libraries (BBC Sound Effects, Hollywood Edge)
- **New approach**: 8-bit/chiptune synthesis using simple waveforms (pulse, triangle, sine) and retro game techniques
- **Inspiration**: Duck Hunt, NES 2A03 sound chip, cartoon sound effects, classic arcade games

#### Pet Sound Implementations

All sounds in `modules/audio_manager.py` (lines 508-806):

**Robot Pet** (lines 508-545):
- R2D2-style chirp with upward pitch bend (600Hz → 900Hz)
- Square wave (pulse) for classic 8-bit character
- Duration: 0.25s with exponential decay
- Description: "Retro R2D2-style chirp - square wave with pitch bend 600-900 Hz"

**Dragon Pet** (lines 547-592):
- Deep growl with downward portamento slide (280Hz → 180Hz)
- Triangle wave for warmer, less harsh tone
- Duration: 0.4s with ASR envelope
- Description: "8-bit growl - triangle wave portamento slide 280-180 Hz"

**Owl Pet** (lines 594-628):
- Classic "hoo-hoo" pattern with two hoots at 420Hz
- Pure sine wave, bell-shaped envelope
- Duration: 0.18s per hoot with 0.12s gap
- Description: "Classic hoo-hoo - two sine wave hoots at 420 Hz"

**Cat Pet** (lines 630-674):
- Cartoon meow with pitch contour (600Hz → 900Hz → 500Hz)
- Triangle wave with vibrato on held portion
- Duration: 0.35s with pitch variation
- Description: "Cartoon meow - triangle wave with pitch bend and vibrato"

**Dog Pet** (lines 676-742) - **Iterated 3 times for quality**:
- High-pitched yap with pitch drop (1100Hz → 700Hz)
- Triangle wave dominant (70%) + sine (30%) for warmth
- Softer 20ms attack to avoid percussive "tapping" sound
- Duration: 0.15s per bark with 0.08s gaps, three barks total
- Description: "High-pitched yap - triangle wave with pitch drop 1100-700 Hz"
- **Iterations**: Started with pulse wave at 460Hz, then multi-channel NES approach, finally settled on pitch-swept triangle for vocal quality

**Phoenix Pet** (lines 744-762):
- Magical ascending arpeggio (E5→G5→B5→E6: 659, 784, 988, 1319 Hz)
- Triangle waves for chime character
- Duration: 0.12s per note
- Description: "Magical chime - ascending triangle wave arpeggio"

**Tribble Pet** (lines 764-806):
- High-pitched cute squeak at 3700Hz with vibrato
- Pure sine wave with 8Hz vibrato (8% depth)
- Duration: 0.3s with gentle ASR envelope
- Description: "Cute squeak - high sine wave at 3700 Hz with vibrato"

#### Research & Analysis

**Sound Library Analysis**:
- Analyzed cartoon sounds from Hollywood Edge Cartoon Trax (dog at 460Hz, small creatures at 3730Hz)
- Analyzed retro game sounds from AlienOutback (bleep at 615Hz, blip at 535Hz)
- Confirmed Duck Hunt dog bark used multi-channel synthesis

**Chiptune Research**:
- Studied 8-bit synthesis principles: simple waveforms, pure tones, limited channels
- Key techniques: pulse/square waves, triangle waves, sine waves, white noise
- Emphasis on portamento (pitch slides), vibrato, arpeggios
- Typical characteristics: short duration (0.2-0.5s), clean envelopes, no realistic complexity

#### Learn Sounds Menu Updates

Updated descriptions in `keyquest.pyw` (lines 696-702):
- All 7 pet sounds now include synthesis method and frequency information
- Descriptions clearly indicate retro/chiptune style
- Technical details provided for educational value

#### Files Modified

**`modules/state_manager.py`**:

- **Sine**: Owl, Tribble (pure tone, smooth)
- **Mixed**: Dog uses triangle + sine for vocal quality

**Pitch Techniques**:
- **Upward bend**: Robot chirp
- **Downward slide**: Dragon growl, Dog yap
- **Pitch contour**: Cat meow (up-hold-down)
- **Arpeggio**: Phoenix chime
- **Vibrato**: Cat, Tribble

**Envelope Design**:
- Sharp exponential decay for percussive character (Robot)
- ASR (Attack-Sustain-Release) for sustained sounds (Dragon, Tribble)
- Soft attack to avoid percussive artifacts (Dog - 20ms ramp)
- Bell-shaped for natural hoots (Owl)

#### User Feedback Iterations

**Dog Sound - 3 Iterations**:
1. **Initial**: Pulse wave at 460Hz - "sounds like tapping on tin"
2. **Second**: Multi-channel approach (pulse + triangle + noise) - "still sounds like tapping"
3. **Final**: Pitch-swept triangle (1100→700Hz) with soft attack - vocal yap quality achieved

**All Other Pets**: Approved on first iteration after applying chiptune principles

## 2025-11-10 Night Session - Game Consolidation

### Major Refactoring: Word Games Consolidated 🎮
**Combined 3 buggy word games into 1 clean, simple game**

**The Problem**:
You know how we had Speed Burst, Word Race, and Typing Defender? They were all pretty much the same thing - type words under pressure. But they all had these annoying crashes on startup. Speed Burst would crash during the countdown (it was trying to call a sound that didn't exist). Word Race and Typing Defender had similar issues. Plus, having 3 games that basically do the same thing felt redundant.

**What I Did**:
I created a brand new game called "Word Typing" that takes the best parts of all three and makes it super simple and crash-free. Then I deleted the 3 buggy games and updated the main program to use the new one.

**New Word Typing Game**:
- Simple and clean: Words appear, you type them, press Enter to submit
- Mixed difficulty (pulls from easy, medium, and hard word lists)
- 30 seconds to type as many words as you can
- Tracks your WPM (words per minute), accuracy, and total words
- No countdown bugs - the whole implementation is rock solid
- Follows the BaseGame architecture like all the other games

**Technical Details**:
- **ADDED**: `games/word_typing.py` (287 lines) - The new consolidated game
- **REMOVED**: `games/speed_burst.py` (deleted)
- **REMOVED**: `games/word_race.py` (deleted)
- **REMOVED**: `games/typing_defender.py` (deleted)
- **MODIFIED**: `keyquest.pyw` (lines 115-116, 614-617):
  - Changed imports from 3 word games to just 1 WordTypingGame
  - Updated the games list from 4 games down to 2 (Letter Fall + Word Typing)

**Game Count**:
- Before: 4 games (Letter Fall, Speed Burst, Word Race, Typing Defender)
- After: 2 games (Letter Fall, Word Typing)

**What This Fixes**:
- ✅ No more crashes when starting word games
- ✅ Cleaner codebase (1 file instead of 3)
- ✅ Easier to maintain
- ✅ Simple, focused gameplay
- ✅ All hotkeys work correctly

**Controls for Word Typing**:
- Type the word: Letter keys
- Submit word: Enter
- Correct mistakes: Backspace
- Repeat current word: Ctrl+Space
- Exit game: Escape

## 2025-11-10 Late Evening - Dialog System Crash Fix & Sound Improvements

### Progress Tone Sound Improved 🔊
**Redesigned progress tone to be more audible - derivative of item complete sound**

**Problem #1**: Progress tone was hard to hear
- Used a frequency sweep chirp (600-1000 Hz)
- Only 50ms duration
- Different character from other game sounds

**Problem #2**: Both sounds played at completion
- Progress tone played at 100% completion
- Then success sound also played
- Double sound was jarring

**Solution Part 1**: Made progress tone a derivative of the item complete (success) sound
- Uses the same note structure as success sound but condensed to single tone
- Starts at G5 (784 Hz) like first note of success sound
- Rises to E6 (1319 Hz) as percentage increases
- Uses same harmonic structure (fundamental + octave harmonic)
- 80ms duration (same as each success sound note)
- Same envelope style for audio consistency

**Solution Part 2**: Only play progress tone during word, not at completion
- Reordered logic: check for completion first
- If complete: play success sound only
- If not complete: play progress tone
- No more double sound at 100%

**Benefits**:
- More audible and clear
- Feels related to success sound (family resemblance)
- Pitch rises as you progress through word (musical feedback)
- No jarring double sound at completion
- Still quick enough to not break typing flow

**Files Modified**:
- `modules/audio_manager.py` (lines 100-134): Completely rewrote `make_progressive_tone()`
- `keyquest.pyw` (lines 2476-2484): Reordered to prevent double sound at completion

---

### Sound Label Correction 🔊
**Updated timeout sound label to match actual sound**

**Problem**: Learn Sounds menu labeled timeout sound as "Timeout Buzz" with description "Low buzz when time runs out in a test"
- Actual sound is a descending melodic chime (G5→E5→C5→G4), not a harsh buzz
- Sound was updated in earlier version but label wasn't updated to match

**Fix**: Updated Learn Sounds menu entry
- Changed name from "Timeout Buzz" to "Time's Up Chime"
- Changed description from "Low buzz when time runs out in a test" to "Descending melody when time runs out in a test"
- More accurately describes the neutral, informative descending pattern

**Files Modified**:
- `keyquest.pyw` (line 695): Updated sound name and description

## 2025-11-10 Late Evening - Dialog System Crash Fix & Improvements

### CRITICAL FIX: Dialog Crashes Fixed 🐛
**Fixed crashes when closing dialogs - wx.App initialization timing issue**

**The Problem**: Dialogs crashed when closing with ANY method (Enter, Escape, clicking OK)
- User reported crashes persisted through multiple fix attempts
- Affected: ALL dialogs (Sentence Practice, Achievements, Reports, Quests, Badges, Games)
- Root cause: **wx.App created on-demand during pygame runtime**

**Root Cause Analysis** (based on wxPython/pygame integration research):
- **Critical timing issue**: Creating wx.App AFTER pygame already running
- wxPython wiki: "Merely importing pygame does some initialization which makes setting environment variables useless"
- pygame and wxPython have **incompatible event loops** when mixed after initialization
- Creating wx.App on-demand (during ShowModal) caused crashes with pygame's event loop
- Each modal dialog tried to create/verify wx.App while pygame was actively running

**The Solution** (based on wxPython/pygame integration best practices):
1. **Initialize wx.App ONCE at application startup** - BEFORE pygame.init()
2. **Never create wx.App on-demand** - Reuse the single instance throughout app lifetime
3. **Let ShowModal have exclusive control** - No pygame event pumping during dialog
4. **Simplified cleanup** - Only clear pygame events after dialog destroyed
5. **wx.CallAfter() for safe closing** - Prevents unbind-while-executing crashes

**What Changed**:
- **ADDED**: wx.App initialization in KeyQuestApp.__init__() BEFORE pygame.init()
- **CHANGED**: dialog_manager checks for existing wx.App instead of creating one
- **REMOVED**: All pygame event pumping during ShowModal
- **SIMPLIFIED**: Cleanup only clears pygame events after dialog destroyed

**Files Modified**:
- `keyquest.pyw`:
  - Lines 570-582: Initialize wx.App FIRST before pygame (critical timing fix)
- `modules/dialog_manager.py`:
  - Lines 70-78: Check for existing wx.App instead of creating on-demand
  - Lines 115-140: wx.CallAfter() pattern for safe dialog closing
  - Lines 149-151: NO pygame event pumping during modal
  - Lines 159-165: ShowModal has exclusive control
  - Lines 177-191: Simplified cleanup - clear pygame events only
- `keyquest.pyw`:
  - Lines 823-830: Error handling for menu announcements

**What Should Work Now**:
- ✅ All dialogs open without crash
- ✅ All methods of closing work (Enter, Escape, clicking OK, Tab+Enter)
- ✅ Program continues running after any dialog
- ✅ No event loop conflicts between pygame and wxPython
- ✅ Single wx.App instance for entire application lifetime

**Key Learning**: When mixing pygame and wxPython, initialize wx.App BEFORE pygame.init() - never create it on-demand during pygame runtime.

---

### Enhanced Dialog Error Logging 🔧
**Added comprehensive error logging to dialog system for better debugging**

**Problem**: User reported crashes when opening dialogs outside of games
- Existing error handling caught exceptions but only printed to console
- No log file created to track what was actually crashing
- Silent failures made debugging difficult

**Solution**: Added comprehensive error logging throughout dialog_manager
- New `log_dialog_error()` function writes detailed errors to `dialog_errors.log`
- Error logging added at every critical point:
  - wx.App creation (line 73-75)
  - Dialog creation (line 82-84)
  - Event binding (line 155-157)
  - Timer setup (line 172-174)
  - Dialog centering (line 179-180)
  - ShowModal call (line 185-187)
  - Timer stop (line 193-194)
  - Dialog destruction (line 209-210)
- Each error logs: error type, message, and full traceback
- Logging failures don't crash the program

**Files Modified**:
- `modules/dialog_manager.py`:
  - Lines 7-9: Added imports (traceback, sys, pathlib)
  - Lines 25-36: Added `log_dialog_error()` function
  - Lines 70-84: Added error logging for wx.App and Dialog creation
  - Lines 152-194: Added error logging for event binding, timer, centering, ShowModal
  - Lines 207-210: Added error logging for dialog destruction

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Any dialog crash will now be logged to `dialog_errors.log` with full details
- ✅ Easier to diagnose what's causing crashes
- ✅ Error handling still allows fallback to console if wxPython fails
- ✅ All dialogs centralized through dialog_manager (verified)

**What to Do If Dialogs Crash**:
1. Reproduce the crash
2. Check `dialog_errors.log` in KeyQuest root directory
3. Log will show exactly which operation failed and why
4. Report the log contents for quick debugging

## 2025-11-10 Late Evening - Letter Fall Refactoring

### Major Code Refactoring 🔧
**Refactored Letter Fall game to inherit from BaseGame like other games**

**Problem**: Letter Fall was implemented as a standalone class with duplicate code
- Other 3 games (Speed Burst, Word Race, Typing Defender) all inherit from BaseGame
- Letter Fall had ~160 lines of duplicate code reimplementing menu handling, dialogs, drawing
- This caused the dialog crash bug and made maintenance harder

**Solution**: Completely refactored Letter Fall to use BaseGame
- Now inherits from BaseGame like other games
- Removed all duplicate code (menu handling, dialog methods, drawing infrastructure)
- Reduced file size from 464 lines to 303 lines (-35% code)
- Game functionality remains identical but code is much cleaner

**What Was Removed** (all provided by BaseGame now):
- Menu state management (mode, menu_items, menu_index)
- Color constants (BG, FG, ACCENT, DANGER, GOOD)
- Methods: start(), say_game_menu(), handle_input(), handle_menu_input()
- Methods: show_how_to_play(), show_controls(), show_description(), show_game_results()
- Methods: draw(), draw_menu()
- Imports: threading (unused), dialog_manager (comes from BaseGame)

**What Was Kept** (game-specific code):
- Game state (running, score, lives, combo, letters, fall_speed, etc.)
- Methods: start_playing(), handle_game_input(), update(), draw_game()
- Helper methods: try_hit_letter(), spawn_letter(), announce_score(), announce_current_letters()

**Files Modified**:
- `games/letter_fall.py`:
  - Line 11: Changed to `from games.base_game import BaseGame`
  - Line 15: Changed class to `class LetterFallGame(BaseGame):`
  - Line 26: Added `super().__init__(...)` call
  - Lines removed: ~160 lines of duplicate code
  - Total: 464 lines → 303 lines (-161 lines, -35%)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Consistent with other games - all 4 games now use BaseGame
- ✅ Easier to maintain - changes to BaseGame benefit all games
- ✅ Less code duplication - DRY principle followed
- ✅ Fixed dialog crash bug as a side effect of proper structure
- ✅ All game dialogs (How to Play, Controls, Description, Results) work correctly

## 2025-11-10 Evening - First Letter Navigation & Screen Reader Limitation Discovery

### Main Menu First Letter Navigation ⚡
**Added quick navigation to main menu - press first letter to jump to menu items**

**Feature Details**:
- Press G to jump instantly to "Games: G"
- Press T for "Tutorial: T"
- Press O for "Options: O"
- All 15 menu items now display hotkey letter after colon

**Smart Cycling for Duplicate Letters**:
- When multiple items share first letter, pressing the key cycles through them
- **S** cycles: "Speed Test: S" → "Sentence Practice: S" → back to Speed Test
- **K** cycles: "Keyboard Explorer: K" → "Key Performance: K"
- **L** cycles: "Lessons: L" → "Learn Sounds: L"
- **V** cycles: "View Badges: V" → "View Quests: V"
- System remembers your position in each letter's cycle

**User Experience Improvements**:
- Menu announcement updated to mention letter navigation
- Colon format (": X") chosen over parentheses for cleaner screen reader pauses
- Less punctuation for screen readers to announce
- Maintains backwards compatibility - arrow key navigation still works

**Technical Implementation**:
- Added `enable_letter_nav` parameter to Menu class (defaults to False for other menus)
- Implemented `navigate_to_letter(letter)` method with cycle tracking
- Added `letter_cycle_index` dictionary to track position for each letter
- Menu handler intercepts letter key presses when enabled
- Selection callback strips ": X" suffix to maintain compatibility with existing code

**Files Modified**:
- `modules/menu_handler.py`:
  - Lines 370-394: Added `enable_letter_nav` parameter and cycle tracking
  - Lines 455-497: Added `navigate_to_letter()` method with cycling logic
  - Lines 521-523: Added letter key detection in `handle_input()`
  - Lines 304-307: Updated main menu announcement to mention letter navigation
- `modules/state_manager.py`:
  - Line 272: Updated all 15 menu items to append ": X" hotkey letter
- `keyquest.pyw`:
  - Line 645: Enabled `enable_letter_nav=True` for main menu
  - Lines 754-756: Strip ": X" suffix in selection handler

### Screen Reader Limitation Documented 🔍
**Discovered and documented why Insert key combos don't work with NVDA/JAWS**

**Root Cause Analysis**:
Through debug logging and testing, discovered that:
1. **NVDA intercepts Insert key** before pygame receives it (Insert is NVDA's modifier key)
2. **NVDA intercepts numpad navigation** (NumLock OFF) for object navigation
3. When Insert key is pressed, pygame never receives the key event at all
4. This is **correct behavior** - screen readers must capture their modifier key first

**Design Decision**:
- Removed Insert key combination detection from Keyboard Explorer
- It won't work with screen readers running, so no point trying to support it
- Screen reader commands should be learned through the screen reader's own help system
  - NVDA: Insert+1 for keyboard help
  - JAWS: JAWSKey+J then K for keyboard help
- Keyboard Explorer focuses on what it can teach: Control combos, F keys, physical layout

**Changes Made**:
- Removed `SCREEN_READER_COMMANDS` dictionary (was Insert+Up/Down/T/F7/B)
- Removed Insert key detection logic from `get_key_description()`
- Updated Insert key description to explain it's captured by screen readers
- Added code comment explaining why Insert detection was removed
- Removed all debug logging code after diagnosis complete

**Files Modified**:
- `modules/keyboard_explorer.py`:
  - Line 101: Updated Insert key description to mention screen reader interception
  - Lines 162-165: Replaced SCREEN_READER_COMMANDS with explanation comment
  - Lines 432-439: Simplified modifier detection, removed Insert combo checking
  - Removed: All Insert key combination logic
- `keyquest.pyw`:
  - Removed: Debug logging added during investigation

**What Still Works in Keyboard Explorer**:
✅ All 26 Control key combinations (Ctrl+S, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, etc.)
✅ All F1-F12 keys with common uses
✅ All letters, numbers, punctuation with proper names
✅ Physical keyboard layout (F and J bumps, numpad positions)
✅ Capital letter detection
✅ Numpad keys (when NumLock is ON)

**What Screen Readers Intercept**:
❌ Insert key and Insert combinations (screen reader modifier)
❌ Numpad navigation keys when NumLock OFF (object navigation in NVDA)
✅ This is expected and correct - not a bug

### Impact Summary
**First Letter Navigation**:
- ✅ Much faster main menu navigation for experienced users
- ✅ Duplicate letters cycle automatically
- ✅ Cleaner screen reader experience with colon format
- ✅ Fully backwards compatible

**Screen Reader Limitation**:
- ✅ Properly documented limitation vs trying to make it work
- ✅ Keyboard Explorer focuses on what it can teach effectively
- ✅ Users directed to proper resources for screen reader commands
- ✅ Code simplified by removing unused Insert detection

### Files Changed This Session
- `modules/menu_handler.py` (letter navigation added)
- `modules/state_manager.py` (menu items updated with hotkeys)
- `modules/keyboard_explorer.py` (Insert detection removed, descriptions clarified)
- `keyquest.pyw` (menu initialization, selection handler updated)

## 2025-11-04 - User Experience & Speech System Improvements

### Major Enhancement 🎉
**TTS Settings Control - Voice, Rate, and Volume**

**New Feature - Customizable TTS Settings**:
- Added TTS rate control (50-400 WPM in 50 WPM increments)
- Added TTS volume control (10%-100% in 10% increments)
- Added TTS voice selection (cycles through all available system voices)
- Settings persist across sessions
- Applied in real-time when changed in options menu

**How to Use**:
- Go to Options menu
- Navigate to "TTS Rate", "TTS Volume", or "TTS Voice"
- Use Left/Right arrows to adjust values
- Changes apply immediately - hear the difference!
- Settings are saved when you exit options

**Files Modified**:
- `modules/state_manager.py` (lines 207-210, 314-316, 402-404): Added TTS settings to state and save/load
- `modules/menu_handler.py` (lines 51-115, 186-253): Added TTS explanation, cycling, and voice name functions
- `keyquest.pyw` (lines 498-548, 704-727, 784-806, 837, 1459-1465): Added TTS methods and options menu integration

**What This Adds**:
- ✅ Full control over TTS speech rate (speed)

- ✅ Select from all available Windows voices
- ✅ Settings saved and restored on app restart
- ✅ Real-time preview when changing settings

---

**Implemented intelligent speech backend detection and switching**

**New Feature - Smart Autodetect**:
- Speech system now intelligently detects if a screen reader is actually running
- "Auto" mode now works correctly: uses screen reader if detected, otherwise uses TTS
- Both Tolk and pyttsx3 are now initialized simultaneously, allowing runtime switching
- Previously: Tolk would load even without screen reader, causing silent failures

**How It Works**:
- On startup, calls `tolk.detect_screen_reader()` to check for running screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, etc.)
- If screen reader detected → uses Tolk backend
- If no screen reader → automatically uses pyttsx3 TTS
- User can override with manual mode selection in Options

**Bug Fix - TTS Mode Not Working**:
- **Problem**: Selecting "TTS" mode in options didn't actually switch to TTS - still tried to use screen reader
- **Root Cause**: `apply_speech_mode()` only toggled `enabled` flag but never changed the `backend`
- **Fix**: Implemented proper backend switching in `apply_speech_mode()` for all modes (auto, screen_reader, tts, off)
- **Result**: TTS mode now works on Windows even without a screen reader running

**Files Modified**:
- `keyquest.pyw` (lines 424-474): Rewrote Speech.__init__() with intelligent detection
- `keyquest.pyw` (lines 1359-1404): Rewrote apply_speech_mode() to actually switch backends
- `keyquest.pyw` (line 500): Updated cleanup to use _tolk_available flag

**What This Fixes**:
- ✅ TTS mode now works correctly - actually uses pyttsx3 instead of Tolk
- ✅ Auto mode intelligently picks the right backend based on what's running
- ✅ Users without screen readers can now hear speech via TTS
- ✅ No more silent failures when screen reader isn't running
- ✅ Runtime backend switching between screen reader and TTS

### Bug Fixes ✅
**Fixed menu navigation, visual highlighting, and build script issues**

**Bug #1 - Visual Highlight Not Moving During Menu Navigation**:
- **Problem**: When navigating menus with arrow keys, the visual highlight stayed on the first item instead of moving to show the current selection
- **Root Cause**: Draw functions used `state.menu_index` (never updated) instead of the Menu class's `current_index` (properly updated during navigation)
- **Fix**: Changed all menu draw functions to use the Menu object's `current_index` property
- **Files**: `keyquest.pyw` (lines 2735, 2775, 2802, 2809, 2875)
- **Result**: Visual highlight now moves correctly when navigating all menus (main menu, lessons, games, options, learn sounds)

**Bug #2 - Main Menu Always Resets to First Item**:
- **Problem**: When returning to the main menu from any mode (lessons, options, games), it always jumped back to the first item (Tutorial) instead of remembering where you were
- **Root Cause**: `_return_to_main_menu()` function called `reset_index()` which set menu position to 0
- **Fix**: Removed `reset_index()` call and changed to `announce_current()` to preserve last position
- **Files**: `keyquest.pyw` (lines 716-720)
- **Result**: Menu now stays on your last selected item when returning from submenus

**Bug #3 - Zip Script Uses Hardcoded Paths**:
- **Problem**: `create_source_package.bat` used Windows locale-dependent date formatting (`%date%`) which fails on different systems
- **Root Cause**: Date substring offsets (like `%date:~-4,4%`) depend on system locale settings
- **Fix**:
  - Changed to PowerShell's `Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd'` for reliable date formatting
  - Changed from 7z/tar to PowerShell's `Compress-Archive` for cross-platform compatible ZIP creation
  - Updated version to v1.0.1 in package name
- **Files**: `create_source_package.bat` (lines 10-12, 50-60)
- **Result**: Script now works reliably across different Windows configurations

**Menu Navigation Fixes**:
- ✅ Visual highlight moves when navigating menus (you can see which item is selected)
- ✅ Menu position preserved when returning from submenus (no more jumping to Tutorial every time)

**Build Script Fixes**:
- ✅ Build script works on all Windows systems regardless of locale
- ✅ ZIP files created with proper cross-platform path handling

**Files Modified**:
- `keyquest.pyw` (lines 716-720, 2735, 2775, 2802, 2809, 2875): Menu highlighting and position fixes
- `create_source_package.bat` (lines 10-12, 50-60): Fixed date format and ZIP creation

- **Key Insight**: Kondo's principle - "melody tied to gameplay rhythm" - sounds should match typing tempo, not break flow
- **Two-Tier System Implemented**:
  - **TIER 1 - During Active Typing** (rhythm-matched, instant feedback):
    - Correct key: ~80ms (Mario coin sound)
    - Wrong key: ~130ms (Duck Hunt miss)
    - Progress tone: ~50ms (rising chirp)
    - Item complete: ~240ms (3 rising tones)
  - **TIER 2 - Dialog Pops Up** (celebratory, elaborate):
    - Victory (lesson complete): ~780ms (Mario 1-Up)
    - Unlock (new lesson): ~540ms (melodic jingle with chords)
    - Badge (badge earned): ~420ms (3-note coin jingle)
    - Level up: ~560ms (PowerUp rising arpeggio)
    - Quest complete: ~960ms (grand fanfare with chords)
    - Timeout: ~1400ms (neutral descending melody - informative, not gloomy)

**Sound Improvement Refinements (Authentic Nintendo-Inspired Sounds):**
- **Enhancement**: Analyzed actual Mario and Duck Hunt sound files from user's game audio collection to create authentic Nintendo-inspired sounds with harmonics
- **Analysis Performed**:
  - Analyzed 10+ classic game sounds from user's Mario and Duck Hunt folders
  - Extracted frequency data, harmonics, and musical characteristics
  - Identified use of rich harmonics (fundamental + perfect fifth/octave), chords, and melodic patterns
- **Key Findings**:
  - Mario Coin: E6 (1319Hz) with B7 harmonic (2637Hz) - perfect fifth overtone
  - Mario 1-Up: E5→G5→E6→E6→G6→E7 with octave harmonics
  - Mario PowerUp: Rising arpeggio in D major (D4→F#4→A4→D5→F#5→A5→D6)
  - Duck Hunt Missed: A5 (880Hz) descending - NOT 180Hz!
  - All sounds use harmonics for richness, not just single tones
- **Changes Made**:
  - ✅ **Correct Key**: Mario coin sound (E6 with B7 harmonic) - rich, bright coin collection sound
  - ✅ **Wrong Key**: Duck Hunt miss sound (880Hz→698Hz descending) - authentic "miss" feel, much more noticeable than 180Hz
  - ✅ **Progress Tone**: Unique frequency-sweep chirp (600-1300Hz) rising with completion percentage
  - ✅ **Lesson Complete (Victory)**: Mario 1-Up style (E5→G5→E6→E6→G6→E7) with octave harmonics for rich sound
  - ✅ **Lesson Unlock**: Two-part melodic jingle with chords (G4+B4, D5+G5) then triumphant arpeggio (C5→E5→G5→C6)
  - ✅ **Badge Earned**: Two-note coin jingle (B5→E6) with harmonics - both notes have octave/fifth overtones
  - ✅ **Level Up**: Mario PowerUp rising arpeggio in D major (D4→F#4→A4→D5→F#5→A5→D6) with octave harmonics
  - ✅ **Quest Complete**: Triumphant fanfare (G4-G4-G4-E5, C5+E5 chord, G5+C6 chord) with varied rhythm and harmony
  - ✅ **Timeout**: Neutral descending melody (G5→E5→C5→G4) - informative like a clock chime, not harsh or gloomy
- **Files Modified**:
  - `modules/audio_manager.py` (lines 24-25): Changed to use new coin/miss sounds
  - `modules/audio_manager.py` (lines 157-197): Redesigned timeout as neutral descending melody
  - `modules/audio_manager.py` (lines 49-72): Added `make_coin_sound()` with E6+B7 harmonics
  - `modules/audio_manager.py` (lines 74-97): Added `make_miss_sound()` with Duck Hunt-style descending tone (880Hz)

  - `modules/audio_manager.py` (lines 313-357): Redesigned quest complete with fanfare pattern and chords

**What This Improves**:
- ✅ **Typing flow preserved**: TIER 1 sounds (<240ms) don't interrupt typing rhythm (Kondo's "gameplay rhythm" principle)
- ✅ **Achievements feel rewarding**: TIER 2 sounds (400-960ms) can be elaborate because dialogs pause action
- ✅ Correct key now has Mario coin richness with perfect fifth harmonic (80ms - instant feedback)
- ✅ Wrong key now audible and clear at 880Hz (was barely audible at 180Hz)
- ✅ All sounds use harmonics (fundamental + overtones) for authentic Nintendo feel
- ✅ Victory sound matches Mario 1-Up with octave harmonics
- ✅ Unlock sound uses chords and melodic patterns, not just arpeggios
- ✅ Badge sound richer with 3-note harmony ascending to octave
- ✅ Level up authentic PowerUp rising arpeggio energy
- ✅ Quest complete uses fanfare pattern with rhythm and chords (longest at ~960ms)
- ✅ Timeout sound redesigned as neutral melody (was harsh 200Hz buzz) - informative like a clock chime
- ✅ All sounds now truly Nintendo-inspired based on actual game sound analysis

### Bug Fixes (Part 11)

**Fixed 8 bugs causing program crashes and usability issues:**

**Bug #1 - Menu System Crashes** (Part 10):
- **Bug**: Program crashed when opening menus or returning to main menu
- **Root Cause**: Menu announcement functions were not being called - function objects were passed directly to speech system instead of calling them to get the announcement string
- **Files Fixed**:
  - `modules/menu_handler.py` (lines 298, 403): Added `()` to call initial_announcement lambdas

**Bug #2 - Keyboard Explorer Announces Selection Key**:
- **Bug**: When opening Keyboard Explorer, it announced "Enter key" or "Space key" (whichever was used to select it from menu)
- **Root Cause**: The Enter/Space keypress event that selected the menu item was still in the event queue when Keyboard Explorer started
- **Fix**: Skip only the FIRST Enter/Space keypress (from menu selection), then allow Enter and Space to be explored normally
- **Files Fixed**:
  - `keyquest.pyw` (lines 1523, 1538-1543): Added first_key flag to skip menu selection key only

**Bug #3 - Lesson Crashes on Start**:
- **Bug**: Program crashed when starting any lesson from the lesson menu
- **Root Cause**: `LessonIntroState` and `LessonState` classes were used without the `state_manager.` prefix
- **Fix**: Changed to `state_manager.LessonIntroState()` and `state_manager.LessonState()`
- **Files Fixed**:
  - `keyquest.pyw` (line 1578): Added state_manager prefix to LessonIntroState
  - `keyquest.pyw` (line 1653): Added state_manager prefix to LessonState

**Bug #4 & #5 - Dialog Crashes (Enhanced Protection)**:
- **Bug**: Dialogs still crashed when closing with rapid keypresses or button clicks
- **Root Cause**: Multiple issues - wx.CallAfter queuing multiple calls, event handlers not being unbound, race conditions
- **Fix**: Enhanced dialog protection with multiple layers:
  1. Removed wx.CallAfter (was queuing multiple EndModal calls)
  2. Immediately unbind event handlers when dialog starts closing
  3. Added try-except around EndModal to catch race conditions
  4. Return instead of Skip for handled keys to prevent further processing
- **Files Fixed**:
  - `modules/dialog_manager.py` (lines 90-124): Enhanced on_key and on_ok handlers

**Bug #6 - Space Not Announced in Lessons (End of Sequences)**:
- **Bug**: Sometimes space character not announced when typing in lessons, especially at end of sequences
- **Root Cause**: When lesson extended for struggling students, "Let's practice a bit more" speech immediately cut off by next prompt speech (both priority=True with interrupt)
- **Fix**: Added protection time and 1.5 second delay after extension announcement to allow it to complete before next prompt
- **Files Fixed**:
  - `keyquest.pyw` (lines 1879-1880): Added protect_seconds=2.0 and pygame.time.wait(1500)

**Bug #7 - Control+Space Announces Full Sequence Instead of Remaining**:
- **Bug**: In lessons, pressing Control+Space announced the entire word/sequence instead of just what's left to type
- **Root Cause**: `lesson_prompt()` always announced the full target word, ignoring what user had already typed correctly
- **Fix**: Modified to only announce remaining characters: `remaining = target[len(l.typed):]`
- **Files Fixed**:
  - `keyquest.pyw` (line 1782): Calculate and announce only remaining characters, not full target

**Bug #8 - Confusing Punctuation in Results Dialogs**:
- **Bug**: Results dialogs showed `' ':` for space key in performance stats and `'S'` with quotes for new keys
- **Root Cause**: Keys displayed with quotes for clarity, but made space unreadable and other keys cluttered
- **Fix**: Display space as "space" and remove quotes from all keys in results
- **Files Fixed**:
  - `modules/results_formatter.py` (line 133): Display space as "space" in key performance stats
  - `modules/results_formatter.py` (lines 145-151): Remove quotes from new keys announcement, display space as "space"

**What This Fixes**:
- ✅ Menu navigation working correctly
- ✅ Keyboard Explorer skips menu selection key but allows Enter/Space exploration
- ✅ Lessons start without crashing
- ✅ Dialogs much more stable - handle rapid key presses and button clicks
- ✅ All dialog types (results, info) protected from crashes
- ✅ Space character always announced in lessons (not cut off by other speech)
- ✅ Control+Space announces only remaining characters to type, not full sequence
- ✅ Results dialogs show readable key names without confusing punctuation

**Files Removed**:
- `test_suite.py`: Removed comprehensive automated test suite (was too slow for active debugging)

## 2025-11-02 (v1.0.1) - Light Theme Contrast Fix

### Overview
Fixed light theme contrast issue reported by user - changed highlight color from sky blue to pure blue for better visibility.

### Bug Fix: Light Theme Contrast
**Problem**: Selected text in light theme used sky blue `RGB(200, 220, 255)` which had poor contrast against white background, making menu items and selected text hard to read.

**User Feedback**: "Selected text is sky blue. So it's sky blue on white; I would suggest you use #00F or rgb(0, 0, 255) to better stand out against the white."

**Fix (keyquest.pyw)**:
- Line 133: Changed `HILITE = (200, 220, 255)` to `HILITE = (0, 0, 255)` (initial theme)
- Line 877: Changed `HILITE = (200, 220, 255)` to `HILITE = (0, 0, 255)` (auto-detect light theme)
- Line 892: Changed `HILITE = (200, 220, 255)` to `HILITE = (0, 0, 255)` (manual light theme selection)

**Result**:
- Before: Sky blue `RGB(200, 220, 255)` on white - poor contrast
- After: Pure blue `RGB(0, 0, 255)` or `#0000FF` - excellent contrast
- Selected menu items, input text, and highlighted elements now clearly visible

**Impact**:
- Significantly improved readability for light theme users
- Better accessibility for users with low vision
- Follows user's exact color recommendation

### User Feedback Clarified: Speed Test Results
**User Feedback**: "Would be nice to see WPM and accuracy after speed test"

**Status**: ✅ Already implemented in v1.0

The speed test already displays a complete results dialog showing:
- Words per minute (WPM)
- Accuracy percentage
- Time elapsed (minutes)
- Sentences completed
- Words typed
- Error count

The dialog appears automatically after completing a speed test and includes both visual display and screen reader announcement: "Speed test complete! WPM X, Accuracy Y percent."

**Implementation**: See `keyquest.pyw:1741-1766`

### Files Modified
- **keyquest.pyw**: Light theme HILITE color (lines 133, 877, 892)

### Release Information
- **Version**: 1.0.1
- **Release Date**: 2025-11-02
- **Executable**: Rebuilt with fix
- **Source Package**: KeyQuest-Source-v1.0.1-20251102.zip (148.9 KB)

## 2025-11-01 (Part 9) - Bug Fixes

### Overview
Fixed two critical bugs affecting sentence practice and Letter Fall game.

### Bug Fix 1: Spanish Sentence Loading
**Problem**: When switching to Spanish in options menu, sentence practice still showed ~38% English sentences.

**Root Cause**: The `load_practice_sentences()` function was including all 124 TEST_SENTENCES (English motivational phrases) in ALL practice sessions, even Spanish. This meant:
- English practice: 124 English (TEST_SENTENCES) + 203 English (file) = 327 total
- Spanish practice: 124 English (TEST_SENTENCES) + 203 Spanish (file) = 327 total (38% English!)

**Fix (keyquest.pyw, lines 276-304)**:
- Changed `load_practice_sentences()` to load ONLY language-specific sentences from files
- TEST_SENTENCES now used only as fallback if file loading fails
- Result:
  - English practice: 203 pure English sentences
  - Spanish practice: 203 pure Spanish sentences
  - No more mixed languages!

**Impact**:
- Users now get 100% language-appropriate sentences
- Settings changes are immediately effective
- Better language learning experience

### Bug Fix 2: Letter Fall Game 'L' Key Conflict
**Problem**: In Letter Fall game, pressing 'L' would list all letters instead of hitting the falling 'L' letter.

**Root Cause**: The game uses letters 'a-z' as falling targets (games/letter_fall.py:340). The 'L' key was mapped to "list current letters" command, creating a conflict when 'L' was a falling letter.

**Fix (games/letter_fall.py)**:
- Changed hotkey from 'L' to 'Tab' for listing letters
- Updated all references:
  - Line 21: INSTRUCTIONS updated
  - Line 22: HOTKEYS updated
  - Line 166: `pygame.K_l` → `pygame.K_TAB`
  - Line 203: "L key" → "Tab key" in controls dialog
  - Line 455: "L = list letters" → "Tab = list letters" in UI

**Impact**:
- All letters a-z can now be typed to hit falling letters
- Tab key (non-letter) used for listing command
- No more keyboard conflicts
- Better gameplay experience

### Files Modified
- **keyquest.pyw**: Fixed sentence loading (lines 276-304), added debug logging
- **games/letter_fall.py**: Changed hotkey from L to Tab (5 locations)

## 2025-11-01 (Part 8) - Menu System Optimization

### Overview
Refactored menu system to use reusable Menu classes, eliminating duplication and simplifying menu handling.

### Enhanced Module: menu_handler.py (now 438 lines, +230 from Part 7)
Added two powerful menu classes that eliminate all menu code duplication.

**New Classes:**
- **Menu class** (~115 lines):
  - Generic menu navigation system
  - Supports static and dynamic item lists
  - Handles up/down navigation, selection, escape
  - Methods: `navigate_up/down()`, `select_current()`, `announce_menu()`, `handle_input()`
  - Configurable callbacks for selection and escape

- **OptionsMenu class** (~110 lines):
  - Specialized menu for cycleable settings
  - Supports left/right cycling through option values
  - Automatic announcement of options with explanations
  - Methods: `cycle_current()`, `navigate_up/down()`, `announce_menu()`, `handle_input()`
  - Handles complex option state management

**Changes to keyquest.pyw:**
- Added `_init_menus()` method to create all menu instances
- Added helper methods: `_handle_main_menu_select()`, `_handle_option_change()`, `_quit_app()`, etc.
- Added menu announcement builders: `_get_lesson_menu_announcement()`, etc.
- **Simplified menu handlers**:
  - `handle_menu_input()`: 38 lines → 5 lines (87% reduction)
  - `handle_lesson_menu_input()`: 37 lines → 2 lines (95% reduction)
  - `handle_games_menu_input()`: 32 lines → 10 lines (69% reduction, kept 'H' hotkey special case)
  - `handle_options_input()`: 88 lines → 2 lines (98% reduction!)
- Total menu handler code: 195 lines → 19 lines
- Menu initialization: +150 lines (one-time setup, highly maintainable)
- **Net result**: Better organization, complete elimination of duplicated navigation logic

**Impact on keyquest.pyw:**
- Now 2,444 lines (was 2,460, -16 lines)
- Eliminated ~145 lines of duplicated menu navigation code
- Added ~130 lines of clean menu initialization
- Menu handlers are now trivial wrappers

**Benefits:**
- **Zero duplication**: All menu navigation logic in one place
- **Trivial to add menus**: New menu = 5 lines of initialization
- **Universal improvements**: Fix menu bug once, all menus benefit
- **Special cases handled**: Options menu with left/right, games menu with 'H' hotkey
- **Dynamic menus supported**: Lesson menu updates when lessons unlock
- **Testable**: Menu classes can be unit tested independently
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of menu behavior from application logic

**Future extensibility:**
- Want menu search? Add to Menu class → all menus get it
- Need keyboard shortcuts? One place to implement
- Want menu history? Menu class tracks it
- Hierarchical submenus? Already supported via parent callbacks

---

## 2025-11-01 (Part 3) - Folder Structure Reorganization

### Overview
Reorganized project structure to group all program modules in a dedicated `modules/` folder, keeping only the main keyquest.pyw file in the root.

**New Structure:**
```
KeyQuest/
├── keyquest.pyw                    # ONLY main file in root
├── modules/                        # All program modules
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── dialog_manager.py
│   ├── audio_manager.py
│   ├── results_formatter.py
├── games/                          # Game modules

## 2025-11-01 (Part 2) - Code Refactoring Phase 1: Audio & Results Modules

### Overview
Began systematic code modularization to reduce keyquest.pyw from 3,184 lines. Completed Phase 1: extracted audio and results formatting into focused modules.

### New Module: audio_manager.py
Created centralized audio management system that handles all sound/tone generation.

**What it does**:
- Generates all audio tones using NumPy sine waves
- Caches frequently-used sounds (beep_ok, beep_bad) for performance
- Handles stereo channel conversion for pygame compatibility
- Provides simple API: `audio.beep_ok()`, `audio.play_victory()`, etc.

**Methods**:
- `make_tone(freq, dur_ms)` - Basic sine wave generation
- `make_progressive_tone(percentage)` - Rising pitch based on completion
- `make_success_tones()` - 3 ascending tones for success
- `make_buzz_sound()` - 2-second timeout buzz
- `make_victory_sound()` - Melodic victory sound with envelope
- `play_wave(wave)` - Plays audio through pygame with stereo handling
- `beep_ok()`, `beep_bad()`, `play_success()`, `play_victory()`, `play_buzz()`, `play_progressive()` - Convenience methods

**Changes to keyquest.pyw**:
- Added `import audio_manager` at line 49
- Line 1011: Created `self.audio = audio_manager.AudioManager()` instance
- Removed standalone audio functions (make_tone, make_progressive_tone, make_success_tones, make_buzz_sound, make_victory_sound) - saved ~66 lines
- Removed `_play_wave()`, `beep_ok()`, `beep_bad()` methods - saved ~20 lines
- Updated all audio calls to use `self.audio.*` methods
- Line 1023: Passed `self.audio.play_wave` to games instead of `self._play_wave`

### New Module: results_formatter.py
Created centralized results formatting system for all result displays.

**What it does**:
- Formats results text for tutorial, lessons, speed tests, sentence practice
- Ensures consistent formatting across all modes
- Handles complex logic (unlock messages, encouragement, WPM requirements)
- Returns both formatted text and action flags for lesson results

**Methods**:
- `format_tutorial_results(counts_done, friendly_names)` - Tutorial completion
- `format_lesson_results(accuracy, wpm, total_correct, ...)` - Lesson results with unlock logic
- `format_speed_test_results(wpm, accuracy, time_minutes, ...)` - Speed test stats
- `format_sentence_practice_results(wpm, accuracy, time_minutes, ...)` - Practice stats
- `format_generic_results(title, stats)` - For games or custom modes

**Changes to keyquest.pyw**:
- Added `import results_formatter` at line 52
- Lines 1568-1571: Tutorial results now use `results_formatter.ResultsFormatter.format_tutorial_results()` - saved ~25 lines
- Lines 2064-2115: Lesson results now use `results_formatter.ResultsFormatter.format_lesson_results()` - saved ~65 lines
  - Still handles unlock logic in keyquest.pyw but formats text in module
  - Returns both results_text and action ("advance", "review", "continue")
- Lines 2333-2343: Speed test results use `results_formatter.ResultsFormatter.format_speed_test_results()` - saved ~14 lines
- Lines 2484-2494: Sentence practice results use `results_formatter.ResultsFormatter.format_sentence_practice_results()` - saved ~14 lines

### Impact
**Lines removed from keyquest.pyw**: ~204 lines (6.4% reduction)
- Audio functions and methods: ~86 lines
- Results formatting code: ~118 lines

**New code added**: 2 focused modules (398 total lines)
- audio_manager.py: 189 lines
- results_formatter.py: 209 lines

**Benefits**:
- Smaller, more focused main file
- Easier to test audio and results independently
- Consistent formatting across all result displays
- Better code organization and maintainability
- Sound caching improves performance
- Clear separation of concerns

### What's Next
Phase 1 complete. Phases 2-3 pending:
- **Phase 2**: state_manager.py (dataclasses and save/load logic)
- **Phase 3**: lesson_manager.py, speech_manager.py, menu_handler.py

## 2025-11-01 - Root Folders, Game Fixes, Accessibility & Universal Dialog System

### Folders Now in Root Directory
I configured KeyQuest so the `games/` and `Sentences/` folders are in the root directory alongside the .exe, not buried in `_internal/`.

Changes made in **keyquest.pyw**:
- Added `import os` at line 35
- Created `get_app_dir()` helper function (lines 45-53) that works for both .pyw and .exe:
  - When running as .exe: returns directory of the executable
  - When running as .pyw: returns directory of the script
- Updated sentence loading at line 281 to use `get_app_dir()` instead of `__file__`

Created **KeyQuest-RootFolders.spec**:
- PyInstaller spec file that automatically copies folders to root during build
- Post-build step copies `games/` and `Sentences/` alongside the .exe
- Still bundles cytolk DLLs in `_internal/` for screen reader support

Benefits:
- Users can easily edit sentence files without digging into _internal
- Users can add new games or sentences without rebuilding
- Same folder structure whether running .pyw or .exe

### Fixed Apostrophe Typing Issue
I discovered sentence files used curly apostrophes (') but keyboards produce straight apostrophes ('). When comparing characters, they didn't match, so typing failed.

Solution:
- Source `Sentences/` folder already had straight apostrophes
- Updated dist folder to use straight apostrophes
- Apostrophes now work correctly when typing

### Fixed Letter Fall Game Over Freeze
The game would announce "Game over" then freeze, leaving users confused.

Changes made in **games/letter_fall.py** (lines 314-328):
- Set `mode = "MENU"` when game over (not just `running = False`)
- Added "Returning to menu" to the announcement so users know what's happening
- Created delayed thread to announce menu after 4.5 seconds (after game over message finishes)
- Users now know they're returning to menu and can navigate again

### Universal Dialog System Created
Created centralized dialog system to handle all dialogs consistently across the app.

Created **dialog_manager.py**:
- Universal `show_dialog(title, content, dialog_type)` function
- Handles all dialogs: game results, speed test results, info screens, etc.
- Supports different font types (monospace for results, default for info)
- Crash prevention with dialog_closing guard
- Console fallback if wxPython unavailable
- Wrapper functions: `show_info_dialog()` and `show_results_dialog()`

Updated **keyquest.pyw**:
- Imports dialog_manager (line 46)
- Simplified `show_results_dialog()` and `show_info_dialog()` to use dialog_manager (lines 1181-1187)
- Removed 160+ lines of duplicate dialog code

Updated **games/base_game.py**:
- Added `show_game_results()` method for all games to use
- Dialogs for info screens (How to Play, Controls, Description)
- All games inherit this functionality automatically

Updated **games/letter_fall.py**:
- Game over now shows results in accessible dialog
- Displays final score, high score, max combo
- Performance message based on score
- User-friendly - no more confusing silence after game over

Updated **games/GAME_TEMPLATE.py**:
- Shows proper game over pattern with results dialog
- Documents universal dialog system usage
- All future games will follow this pattern

Benefits:
- One centralized dialog system (easy to maintain)
- All dialogs have consistent behavior and accessibility
- Game results shown in accessible dialogs (like speed test results)
- No overwhelming speech output
- Users can navigate content at their own pace
- Screen readers can read line by line

### keyquest.pyw
**Fixed critical dialog crash bug** (lines 1208-1228)

I added a `dialog_closing` guard flag to the `show_results_dialog` function to prevent multiple `EndModal()` calls. When users rapidly pressed Enter/Escape/Space or clicked OK multiple times, the dialog would crash the entire program.

Changes made:
- Added `dialog_closing = [False]` flag at line 1209
- Modified the `on_key()` function (lines 1212-1219) to check the flag before calling `EndModal()`
- Added new `on_ok()` function (lines 1221-1225) to handle OK button clicks with the same guard
- Used `wx.CallAfter()` to defer `EndModal()` to the next event loop cycle
- Bound the OK button to the new handler at line 1228

This fix affects all results dialogs (speed test, sentence practice, lesson completion).

### games/sounds.py
**Fixed Letter Fall game crash** (lines 67-72)

I fixed the `apply_envelope()` function that was causing a ValueError when the game over sound played. The release phase calculation was trying to write more audio samples than available space.

Changes made:
- Changed the release start calculation at line 69 to use actual phase positions
- Added `actual_release_samples` calculation at line 70 to limit samples to available space
- Wrapped the envelope assignment in an if statement at line 71-72 to only write if space is available

The old code calculated `start = total_samples - release_samples` which could be negative or incorrect. The new code properly tracks where the release phase should begin.

### Documentation
**Consolidated scattered docs into one file**

I created `TECHNICAL_NOTES.md` which combines all technical information:
- Platform compatibility details
- Accessibility fix explanations
- Both bug fixes with code examples
- Folder structure
- Distribution guide
- Developer notes

Removed these files (contents now in TECHNICAL_NOTES.md):
- ACCESSIBILITY_FIX.md
- BUG_ANALYSIS_DIALOG_CRASH.md
- BUG_FIX_LETTER_FALL.md
- FOLDER_STRUCTURE.txt
- PLATFORM_COMPATIBILITY.md

### Distribution
- Updated `KeyQuest-Source.zip` to include both bug fixes
- Rebuilt `dist/KeyQuest/` folder with fixed code
- Added README.txt and README-Full.md to distribution folder
- Cleaned up build artifacts
