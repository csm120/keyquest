# KeyQuest - TODO (Living Checklist)

This file tracks **pending** work only. When an item is completed, remove it (or move it into the changelog: `docs/user/CHANGELOG.md`).

## Current Focus

- Continue reducing `modules/keyquest_app.py` by extracting one cohesive feature at a time (no behavior changes).

## Backlog (Optional)

- Add/expand unit tests when extracting logic (prefer “pure” modules that don’t require audio/display).
- Keep user docs aligned with current accessibility status in `docs/user/`.
