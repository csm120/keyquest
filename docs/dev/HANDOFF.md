This is the single starting point for any human or AI working on KeyQuest.

## Snapshot

- **Last updated**: 2026-03-19 (Shared layout helpers and responsive screen pass)
- **Version**: see `modules/version.py` (single source of truth)
- **Platform**: Windows (full accessibility) / Linux (TTS only)
- **Accessibility**: See user accessibility docs in `docs/user/`.

## Next Session Checklist

1. Open `docs/dev/HANDOFF.md` and `docs/dev/CHANGELOG.md` top entry.
2. Run baseline checks before editing:
   - `python -m unittest`
   - `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/run_quality_checks.ps1`
3. If changing user-visible behavior, update:
   - `README.html` (and pointer `README.md` only if needed)

4. For release work:
   - Update `docs/user/WHATS_NEW.md` in plain language
   - Prefer `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/ship_updates.ps1`
   - Or bump `modules/version.py` manually and run `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/release.ps1`
   - Verify release assets in local `dist/`
   - Verify GitHub Pages and the GitHub Release workflow completed successfully
5. Before handoff:
   - Update this handoff file snapshot + recent changes
   - Commit and push to `main`
   - If releasing, verify GitHub release page and asset links

## Quick Start (For New Sessions)

1. Read this file.
2. Read the top entry in `docs/dev/CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Start implementation from `modules/keyquest_app.py` and the relevant `modules/*` or `games/*` file.

## Repo Map (Where Things Live)

- `keyquest.pyw`: thin entrypoint (runs `modules/keyquest_app.py`).
- `modules/keyquest_app.py`: main application event loop and screen wiring.
- `modules/`: state, lessons, audio, dialogs, menu, shop/pets, etc.
- `games/`: game implementations (`base_game.py`, `letter_fall.py`, `word_typing.py`).
- `ui/`: rendering helpers.
- `Sentences/`: sentence/topic text pools.
- `docs/`: user and developer docs.
- `tools/build/`: batch build scripts and PyInstaller spec.
- `tools/quality/`: quality scripts (contrast audit).

## Run / Test / Build

- Install deps: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run app: `py -3.9 keyquest.pyw`
- Run tests: `python -m unittest`
- Local quality checks: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/run_quality_checks.ps1`
- Build exe: `tools/build/build_exe.bat`
- Build installer: `tools/build/build_installer.bat` (requires Inno Setup 6)
- Full release: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/ship_updates.ps1`
- Build source package: `tools/build/create_source_package.bat`
- Single build entrypoint:
  - `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/build.ps1 -Target all -Clean` (exe + source)
  - `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools/build.ps1 -Target installer` (installer only)
- EXE packaging docs policy: include `README.md`, `README.html`, and user-facing docs under `dist/KeyQuest/docs/`.
- Release policy: `docs/dev/RELEASE_POLICY.md`
- Windows source-launch safeguard: `keyquest.pyw` now relaunches itself with Python 3.9 if file association starts it with a different Python install.
- Python baseline policy: keep source, workflows, linting, and packaging aligned to Python 3.9 for consistency and TTS compatibility.

## Current Status (High Level)

- Core app + Phases 1-4 features implemented.
- New user-facing guide is now `README.html` (plain-language, WCAG-friendly structure). `README.md` is a pointer.
- Keyboard command sentence files were cleaned up for clearer, less technical wording.
- Blog-post helper content is now maintained locally outside Git and should not be treated as a tracked repo asset.
- Hangman is fully integrated and significantly expanded:
  - offline dictionary-backed words/definitions
  - weighted word-length selection centered on common lengths, with occasional short and very long words
  - 10 wrong-guess visual stages with spoken stage descriptions
  - comma-separated spoken word progress tokens for clearer SR pacing
  - Left/Right/Home/End cursor navigation across word-progress positions with visual focus highlight
  - results menu with `Word`, `Definition`, copy action, replay, and sentence-practice bridge
  - sentence-practice prompts use varied style templates (story/mystery/science/etc.) instead of plain repetitive lines
  - sentence-practice `Ctrl+Space` reads remaining text from current typing position
  - `Alt+L` reports letters left and total letters
- Speech formatting is now consistent for repeated letters, spaces, and mismatch feedback.
- Lesson prompts now speak authored practice words naturally, while drill patterns such as `asas` or `aass` are spelled out.
- Early lessons now front-load simpler 2, 3, and 4 key repeated drills before mixed patterns.
- Sentence Practice `Random Topic` excludes Spanish topics; Spanish is still available via `Choose Topic`.
- `Escape x3` return to Main Menu is implemented across active non-menu modes.
  - Escape handling is centralized via `modules/escape_guard.py` + policy routing in `modules/keyquest_app.py`.
- Main menu labels/order updated (`Quests`, `Pets`, `Pet Shop`, `Badges`).
- Main menu now includes `About` (menu-driven info screen with website launch action).
- Word Typing countdown stutter at 10s/5s fixed.
- Startup speech ordering stabilized (title first via SR, then first menu item).
- Fixed slow first down-arrow announcement caused by startup speech protection window.
- Added fixed 250 ms duplicate-speech debounce to reduce stutter/repeats.
- Added spoken/visual goodbye message on app exit.

## Active TODOs / Open Issues

1. Continue modularization of `modules/keyquest_app.py` where practical — `flash_manager` and `font_manager` are extracted; mode dispatch and cross-mode wiring remain candidates.
2. Keep docs in sync with active file layout under `tools/build/` and `tools/quality/`.

## Key Conventions

- Use `self.speech.say("...", priority=True, protect_seconds=2.0)` for important announcements.
- Keep visual and spoken content aligned.
- Use `get_app_dir()` for runtime-safe path resolution (source and frozen exe).
- Update `docs/dev/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/user/WHATS_NEW.md`, and `docs/dev/HANDOFF.md` for meaningful behavior changes.
- For new screens, use `ui/layout.py` for screen size, centering, wrapped blocks, and footer placement.
- For new game chrome, use `ui/game_layout.py` for titles and status stacks.
- Do not hardcode `900`, `600`, `450`, or assume a single-line controls footer in new render code unless there is a documented reason.

## Recent Changes

### 2026-03-19: Shared Layout Helpers and Responsive Screen Pass

- Added `ui/layout.py` for shared screen geometry:
  - live screen size lookup
  - safe content width
  - centered placement helpers
  - wrapped centered and left-aligned text blocks
  - footer row placement
- Added `ui/game_layout.py` for shared game chrome:
  - centered game titles
  - centered status-line stacks
- Refactored `games/base_game.py` and `ui/render_menus.py` to use the shared layout helpers instead of repeating centering and footer math.
- Refactored `games/word_typing.py`, `games/letter_fall.py`, and `games/hangman.py` to use the shared helpers for title, wrapped text, status, and footer placement while keeping gameplay-specific visuals local.
- Added `tests/test_layout.py` to lock in the new helper behavior.
- Accessibility review outcome: keep geometry in layout helpers, keep focus/emphasis in `ui/a11y.py`, and keep gameplay meaning local to each screen.

### 2026-03-07: Code Quality, Test Coverage, and Modularisation Pass

- Extracted `modules/flash_manager.py` (`FlashState`) and `modules/font_manager.py` (`detect_dpi_scale`, `build_fonts`) from `keyquest_app.py`.
- `progress.json` save is now atomic (temp-file + rename) — no data loss on crash.
- `error_logging.py` gained log rotation (2 MB cap) and `log_message()` helper; `dialog_manager.py` now routes errors there instead of a separate file.
- Pet happiness decays 5 pts/day since last fed (applied at load time in `state_manager.py`).
- `keyquest.pyw` now supports `--version` flag; CI EXE smoke test uses it.
- Ruff lint step and EXE smoke test were added to the release workflow.
- `requirements.lock` and `pyproject.toml` (ruff + pytest config) added.
- Test count: 100 → 179 (audio, speech, schema migration, file-not-found paths all covered).
- `docs/dev/ARCHITECTURE.md` added (module map, mode state machine, conventions).
- See top entry in `docs/dev/CHANGELOG.md` for full detail.

### 2026-03-06: Docs, Command Wording, and Release Workflow Refresh

- Added `tools/ship_updates.ps1` as the preferred release entrypoint when you want version bump selection handled for you.
- Added `tools/dev/release_bump.py` to suggest and apply conservative `patch` or `minor` bumps.
- Added `docs/dev/RELEASE_POLICY.md` so `update git` and `ship updates` have distinct meanings.
- Added `docs/dev/CONTENT_STYLE_GUIDE.md` to keep guide, changelog, blog, and sentence wording consistent.
- Audited and simplified Windows, NVDA, and JAWS command sentence files for clearer learner-facing wording.
- Expanded release/process notes in `docs/dev/DEVELOPER_SETUP.md` and refreshed this handoff file.

### 2026-02-25: Accessibility Enhancement Pass (complete)

All items from the accessibility recommendations audit are now implemented. `docs/dev/ACCESSIBILITY_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` has been deleted. `docs/user/ACCESSIBILITY_COMPLIANCE_SUMMARY.md` updated.

**Final three items completed this session:**

**`modules/state_manager.py`**
- Added `font_scale: str = "auto"` to `Settings` dataclass; persisted via `load`/`save`.

**`modules/menu_handler.py`**
- Added `get_font_scale_explanation(scale)` and `cycle_font_scale(current, direction)` helpers.

**`modules/keyquest_app.py`**
- Added `_detect_dpi_scale()` module-level function (ctypes `GetDpiForSystem` / 96).
- Added `_rebuild_fonts()` method: recreates `title_font`, `text_font`, `small_font` at the effective scale; propagates new font objects to all cached game instances.
- `_rebuild_fonts()` called at startup (after `load_progress`) and on Font Size option change.
- Added `Font Size` option to Options menu (`auto` / `100%` / `125%` / `150%`).
- Added `_escape_remaining` / `_escape_noun` instance state.
- `_handle_escape_shortcut()` sets `_escape_remaining` on partial press, clears on completion or reset.
- `draw()` renders a centered top-of-screen text counter while `_escape_remaining > 0` (visual complement to the existing speech announcement).

**`tests/test_test_modes.py`**
- Added `trigger_flash` stub to `_DummyApp` (required by `test_modes._record_typing_error`).

**`README.html`**
- Options section expanded from one line to a full itemized list of all 8 settings (including Font Size).
- Quick Start Escape note updated to mention the on-screen remaining press counter.
- Accessibility section expanded with four new bullets: HC auto-detection, font size/DPI scaling, visual keystroke flash, escape press counter.

**Earlier items (same session):**

**`ui/a11y.py`**
- Added `draw_keystroke_flash(screen, color, alpha, screen_w, screen_h)` — semi-transparent color overlay for visual keystroke feedback.

**`ui/render_results.py`**
- Added `small_font`, `screen_h`, `accent` parameters.
- Added `draw_controls_hint()` at bottom ("Space/Enter continue; Esc menu") — this was the only render screen missing a controls hint.

**`ui/render_tutorial.py`**
- Added `screen_h` parameter.
- Fixed tutorial intro controls hint Y from hardcoded `540` to `screen_h - 60`, matching all other screens.

**`ui/render_menus.py`**
- `draw_lesson_menu()`: silently truncated lesson list now shows "v  more below  v" when items exceed screen height.

**`modules/theme.py`**
- `detect_theme()` now checks Windows High Contrast mode (via `ctypes` / `SPI_GETHIGHCONTRAST`) before `darkdetect`. Users with HC enabled in Windows Settings get the in-app `high_contrast` theme automatically.
- Dark theme HILITE nudged from `(80, 120, 180)` ? `(90, 130, 190)`: contrast ratio improved from 4.69:1 to 5.77:1, giving comfortable margin above the 4.5:1 WCAG AA minimum.

**`modules/notifications.py`**
- Removed emoji characters (`??`, `??`, `badge['emoji']` prefix) from badge and level-up dialog text content. Screen readers that intercept wx TextCtrl content directly no longer expand emoji verbosely. Speech announcement paths (which already used clean text) unchanged.

**`modules/keyquest_app.py`**
- Added `_flash_color` / `_flash_until` state and `trigger_flash(color, duration=0.12)` method.
- `draw()` renders a fading flash overlay after all content when a flash is active.
- `draw_results()` call updated with new `small_font`, `screen_h`, `accent` params.
- `draw_tutorial()` call updated with new `screen_h` param.
- Tutorial correct/incorrect handlers call `self.trigger_flash()` (green / red).

**`modules/lesson_mode.py`**
- `process_lesson_typing()`: calls `app.trigger_flash((0, 80, 0), 0.12)` on correct keystroke, `app.trigger_flash((100, 0, 0), 0.12)` on error.

**`modules/test_modes.py`**
- `_record_typing_error()`: calls `app.trigger_flash((100, 0, 0), 0.12)` on typing error.

**Not implemented (future work — documented in `docs/dev/ACCESSIBILITY_RECOMMENDATIONS.md`):**
- User-adjustable font size (`modules/config.py`) — requires Options menu entry + font re-creation on change.
- DPI scaling — should be paired with font size work; risk of layout regressions across all screens.
- Escape guard visual count — speech already announces remaining presses; visual overlay is low priority.

### 2026-02-19: Version 1.0 Release + About Screen

- Declared milestone release as `Version 1.0` (`modules/version.py`).
- Added `About: A` to the bottom of the main menu (`modules/state_manager.py`).

### 2026-02-19: Hangman UX + Escape Handler Unification

- Added shared escape press tracker: `modules/escape_guard.py`.
- Moved active-mode Escape behavior to centralized policy/handler in `modules/keyquest_app.py`.
  - Keyboard Explorer uses `Escape x3` via the shared path.
  - Sentence Practice finish-on-Escape-x3 now routes through the same centralized handler.
- `games/hangman.py` updates:
  - Word progress speech now uses comma separators (`c, blank, t`) for better SR clarity.
  - Added word-position cursor navigation (`Left/Right/Home/End`) with spoken position feedback and visual focus highlight.
  - Sentence-practice `Ctrl+Space` now announces remaining text based on current typing position.
  - Replaced simple sentence-practice templates with randomized style-based prompts for higher-quality, less repetitive lines.
  - Removed fixed max word length; max is now derived from dictionary data.
  - Updated word selection to favor common lengths while still allowing short and rare very long words.
- Documentation:
  - Updated `README.html` Hangman controls/details.
  - Updated `docs/dev/CHANGELOG.md` with this change set.

### 2026-02-18: User Guide HTML + Packaging + Escape/Hotkey Doc Alignment

  - Replaced user-facing readme content with `README.html` (plain-language, main-menu organized).
  - Added WCAG-oriented page structure for the guide (landmarks, skip link, focus-visible styles).
  - Simplified `README.md` to a pointer to `README.html`.
  - Updated `docs/dev/CHANGELOG.md` with latest Hangman/readme/build notes.
- Build/distribution:
  - Updated `tools/build/KeyQuest-RootFolders.spec` to copy `README.html` to:
    - `dist/KeyQuest/README.html`
    - `dist/KeyQuest/docs/README.html`
- In-app docs text alignment:
  - Updated gameplay hotkey/instruction text for `Letter Fall`, `Word Typing`, and `Hangman` to reflect `Escape x3` exit behavior.

### 2026-02-16: Prompt Clarity + Early Lesson Sequence Length + Random Topic Rule

- `modules/speech_format.py`:
  - Added `spell_text_for_typing_instruction()` for clearer `Type ...` prompts.
  - Uses `then` separators when sequence order is likely important (special keys/spaces or repeated characters).
- `modules/lesson_mode.py`, `modules/keyquest_app.py`, `modules/lesson_manager.py`:
  - Unified typing-prompt formatting on the new helper.
  - Kept mismatch/remaining feedback format unchanged (`Missing: ... Remaining text: ...`).
- `modules/lesson_mode.py`:
  - Early stages (0-5) now normalize practice targets to 3-4 keys for easier recall.
- `modules/test_modes.py`:
  - `Random Topic` now picks from non-Spanish topics only (fallback to all topics if needed).
- Tests:
  - Updated/added coverage in `tests/test_speech_format.py`, `tests/test_lesson_mode.py`, and `tests/test_test_modes.py`.
- Docs:
  - Updated `README.md` and `docs/dev/CHANGELOG.md` to match implemented behavior.

### 2026-02-14: Accessibility + Structure Follow-Through

- Added shared speech-format helpers and consistent mismatch announcements.
- Updated menu labels/order and Word Typing countdown behavior.
- Reorganized root helper/build files into `tools/build/`, `tools/quality/`, and `docs/`.
- Added targeted regression tests in `tests/test_test_modes.py` and `tests/test_word_typing.py`.
- Added adaptive tutorial flow (space-first onboarding, phase pacing based on performance, extra reps for troublesome keys).
- Added typing sound intensity option (`subtle` / `normal` / `strong`) with persistence.
- Updated PyInstaller spec for reorganized repo layout and stabilized Python 3.9 compatibility.
- Updated exe distribution docs policy to include `README.md`, `README.html`, and user-facing docs in `dist/KeyQuest/docs/`.

### 2026-02-14: Startup Speech and Exit UX Follow-Up

- `modules/keyquest_app.py`:
  - Startup menu announcement is timer-driven to avoid racing with screen-reader title announcement.
  - Startup announcement uses non-interrupting speech for first menu item.
  - Removed startup priority protection that delayed first menu arrow navigation speech.
  - Quit path now shows and speaks a brief goodbye message before exiting.
- `modules/speech_manager.py`:
  - Added fixed duplicate-speech debounce (`0.25s`) for identical rapid repeats.

For full details, see the top entry in `docs/dev/CHANGELOG.md`.
