KeyQuest is a typing adventure game for Windows with built-in support for keyboard, screen reader, and low-vision users.

It is aimed at learners who want clearer spoken feedback, keyboard-first navigation, and documentation they can read in a browser or from the app itself.

Download the latest installer or portable ZIP from the [Releases page](https://github.com/WebFriendlyHelp/KeyQuest/releases). Official KeyQuest builds are published there.
